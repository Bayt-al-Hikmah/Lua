# Lua Introduction Course

Welcome to the **Lua Introduction Course** repository by Bayt-al-Hikmah! This collection of lecture notes is designed for beginners and intermediate learners aiming to master Lua programming fundamentals. Whether you're new to coding or refreshing your skills, these notes provide structured, step-by-step guidance through core concepts.

Bayt-al-Hikmah (House of Wisdom) is dedicated to preserving and disseminating knowledge, inspired by the historic intellectual center of the Islamic Golden Age. These lectures emphasize clear explanations, practical examples, and hands-on exercises to build a strong foundation in the Lua language.

## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with computers and file management.
    
- No prior programming experience required (though helpful).
    
- Lua interpreter installed (Lua 5.4 recommended) or access to an online Lua environment (e.g., Lua.orgâ€™s online sandbox).
    

### Setup Instructions

1. Install Lua:
    
    - **Windows/Linux/macOS**: Download from lua.org.
        
    - Alternatively, use an online tool like Replit with Lua support.
        
2. Install an editor/IDE: Visual Studio Code with the Lua extension is recommended for beginners.
    
3. Test your setup: Run a "Hello, World!" program (example in Lecture 1) using:
    
    ```bash
    lua hello_world.lua
    ```
    

## Course Overview

This 5-lecture series covers essential Lua topics progressively. Each lecture includes:

- Theoretical explanations.
    
- Code examples and snippets.
    
- Exercises for practice.
    
- References for further reading.
    


| Lecture   | Topic                                                   | Key Concepts Covered                                                                                               |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Lecture 1 | Variables and Input-Output                              | Variables, data types (number, string, table, etc.), user input/output with io.read/io.write.                      |
| Lecture 2 | Control Flow                                            | Logical/comparison operators, if-else statements, switch-case alternatives (tables), for/while/repeat-until loops. |
| Lecture 3 | Functional Programming, Modules, and External Libraries | Functions, closures, module creation, using external libraries.                                                    |
| Lecture 4 | Object-Oriented Programming and Error Handling          | Metatables, prototyping OOP, pcall for error handling.                                                             |
| Lecture 5 | File Handling and Coroutines                            | File I/O with io library, coroutine creation and management.                                                       |

**Recommended Pace**: 1-2 lectures per week, with time for coding practice. Total estimated time: 15-25 hours.

## Practice and Projects

- **Exercises**: Each lecture ends with coding challenges. Solutions can be added in a separate /exercises folder.
    
- **Mini-Project Ideas**:
    
    - Lecture 2: Simple text-based calculator using control flow.
        
    - Lecture 3: Modular script for a basic game logic system.
        
    - Lecture 5: File-based task scheduler using coroutines.
        
- **Resources**: lua.org for documentation, Lua-users wiki for tutorials, and Exercism Lua track for problems.
